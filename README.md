can find various car brands and view the models under each manufacturer.

Architecture:

1. Server-Side Rendering - using generateStaticParams ensures high performance
   by pre-rendering pages at build time and providing fast loading speeds for
   users;
2. Styling - TailwindCSS is used for adaptive and responsive component and
   cross-browser design;
3. Components - the components folder organizes reusable UI elements, keeping
   the codebase easy to maintain
4. Utils - the utils folder contains all necessary utility functions.
